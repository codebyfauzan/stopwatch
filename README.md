# Stopwatch

This is my first stopwatch app. I build this using HTML, CSS, and Javascript without any library or framework
Also, This project is created for the Final exam of web design for the 4th semester of my college.

What this app can do :
* Displaying current time
* Play, Pause, and Reset the timer
* When you Play, Pause, or Reset the timer, participants time will also get the effect of them
* We also can stop or finish the participants time when we click on the flag button

Next Challenges :
* I want to add number of participant dynamically without editing index.html manually
* When add a participant, I want to add the name too instead of get default name like 'Participant (number)'
